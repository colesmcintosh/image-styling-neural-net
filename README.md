# Image Styling Neural Net
> The model is used to stylize images. A list of images is looped through the model, each image gets stylized based upon Andy Warhol's style (reference image is images\style\style.webp), and saved.
<br/>
<br/>
NFT's of each image can be found in the collection here --> <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aw-liverpool-ai" >Andy Warhol Styled Liverpool by AI</a>
